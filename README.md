# Resume Creator

This project was inspired by [this classic Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7y8k6p/im_an_exrecruiter_for_some_of_the_top_companies/) for the infamous Sheets & Giggles [free resume template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QcZgLCcauW2k1cIC9JcGQFAIfrszyIE2/edit).

Kudos to Colin at [Sheets & Giggles](https://sheetsgiggles.com).
